# EECS_731_SEMESTER_PROJECT_TRENDING
This repo serves as the hub for code from this project on analyzing trending YouTube videos. Regression, Clustering, Anomaly detection and Time series forecasting has been performed on the data.

Regression (Emily Mikeska): Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regression models were trained and evaluated on the Time series data. As I discovered, Random Forest was not well suited for the problem of predicting popular categories of videos. Gradient Boosting regression performed better, but could still be improved. Both models predicted the most popular category ID based on the channel ID, view count, number of likes and dislikes, comment count, publish date, and trending date. To improve over the base model, I focused on optimizing the hyperparameters so that the models could be as accurate as possible with the data provided. The training data was spanned August 11, 2020 to mid October 15, 2020 and the test data spanned  from October 15, 2020 to Octoboer 27, 2020.
