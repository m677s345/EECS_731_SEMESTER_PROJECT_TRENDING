It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050.

You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can.

Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

All of the dates were amazing, with 10 phenomenal guys! We promised y'all that I would pick one of them to go on a second date with. (Well... its actually a little more than that!❤️ #boyfriend) Today I FINALLY get to reveal to y'all who he is!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and more... HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) brooklynandbaileyshop.comAs mentioned during the series, we did our best to follow CDC guidelines in mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing, etc, during each of the dates. We crammed in 2-3 dates per day (Hollywood magic), due to my limited schedule. In fact, before each of the dates... the boys had to either take a covid test or confirm that they had been social distancing for 10-14 days, as I did. In fact, we had to replace 2 of the boys who confirmed that they either had covid or were in close contact with someone who had it in the days leading up to our date. It turns out that the GUY I CHOSE ended up being ONE OF THE REPLACEMENTS!!! When the original date canceled due to covid, Betsy Mikesell and Kaitlyn were SCRAMBLING to find a replacement with only days notice. Kaitlyn remembered a cute family she had taken family photos for 3 years ago, and that they had a son who seemed super nice and really handsome. He had since returned from a 2-year LDS mission to Madagascar, and finished his first year at BYU. When she reached out to him via DM about filling in on this date, he finally remembered who she was, listened to the dating series idea, and said YES!❤️ Watch the whole 10 DATES IN 10 DAYS SERIES here!!!  👉🏻 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj0H71LavJZ9_jfT_YnHxeUkn7yvpDecSWhen we went on our date, we had SO MUCH FUN! I didn't want it to end, and we made excuses (intentionally) to extend the date as long as we could despite the day's hectic #dating schedule.This boy was also the first person I texted when I heard from my mom about the Mikesell's plane crash during one of my last dates. (Everyone survived because of miracles, but there were major injuries... https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU) He helped console me, gave me advice on how to manage the rest of the day, helped Betsy coordinate picking me up, and dropped everything to drive to the Mikesell's and help out in any way he could. Those next several days, he would run any errand Betsy and Brock & Boston needed, praying over them, helping clean the house and taking care of the family dog. He had never met the Mikesell's before. Needless to say, I was VERY impressed!In the 6 weeks since, we've texted/FaceTimed every single day. My extended family was dying to know who I had chosen, as did my friends and hundreds of thousands of you! It was hard not share this all with y'all, because we knew we needed to film this video first! He would send me flowers, or often Postmates my favorite foods, etc, all the time. I wanted SO BAD to share this all with you, but knew I couldn't!We knew we wouldn't see each other until the 16th of September, when he planned to fly out for a visit. Little did I know, but, Bailey and my mom had been planning to fly him out early as a SURPRISE for me! I LITERALLY HAD NO IDEA, because he wasn't supposed to show up for three more days! So last Sunday he showed up in Dallas, and Bailey and my mom filmed my reaction. Then we both sat down and filmed a segment to share a little about how we got to where were are! I am SO HAPPY!

We’ve moved back to Canada!  Sorry for the worry we might have caused you all, but I’m sure you can understand that it was an extremely tough decision to make. We took time off from social media and from posting videos to really think about what we were going to do. To get these changes in motion.  We were both concerned about the well being of our families during this time. As for me (Martina), since my dad passed away, I was especially worried about my mom being isolated and alone due to the necessary social distancing.  My plan is to spend more time with her, maybe even learn some recipes that I can share with you all for Martina’s Midnight Munchies!Simon has taken a step back from being on camera and he has gotten back into writing, something he truly loved doing while in university.  He’s working on a book and has even been contemplating enrolling back into school. But currently he's been a bit busy with... well, you’ll see in the next video 😉 Majority of us have had to make massive changes during this time period.  Covid has changed the way of the world, so we’re going to have to change with it.  I’ve always enjoyed making videos, editing, creating music, doodling so I’d like to keep sharing whatever ideas come out of my crazy head. Of course, I've also got some Build A Ladder segments I've been planning, so I'm going to give myself a smaller work load but try to be more consistent. We'll see if I can stick to my personal goals. Simon too is also going to focus on the creative ideas and processes that he enjoys, so we're looking to more flexible.It’ll be a change, but we’ve dealt with change before. Hopefully some of you will stick around and will enjoy the new changes 2020 will bring to our channel.",True,5,27,53,40,0,0,26,95,41,27,82,0,0,27,0,55,29,33,67,27,27,43,28,28,0,82,0,28,27,29,29,29,28,27,27,28,0,28,28,29,27,0,0,0,56,55,0,0,27,29,29,0,29,28,27,0,58,0,28,0,0,0,0,56,0,43,100,26.757575757575758,24.2306221271453,5,7,4,5,27,53,40,0,0,26,95,41,27,82,0,0,27,0,55,29,33,67,27,27,43,28,28,0,82,0,28,27,29,29,29,28,27,27,28,0,28,28,29,27,0,0,0,56,55,0,0,27,29,29,0,29,28,27,0,58,0,28,0,0,0,0,56,0,43,100,26.757575757575758,24.2306221271453,5

For a two-and-a-half-minute clip, The Batman trailer presents a lot of broad moving parts but not a lot of answers. Still, there are a few subtle details that may have slipped under your radar.As we see Commissioner Gordon and the Dark Knight investigate a murder scene wallpapered with political newspaper clippings, one headline in particular stands out: Maroni Drug Bust!While he may not stand tall among the ranks of the Caped Crusader's colorful super-powered rogues gallery, mob boss Sal Maroni has loomed large over the street-level corners of the Batman mythos ever since his first appearance on the comics page in 1942. His most distinctive accomplishment in the canon? Splashing District Attorney Harvey Dent with the acid that would transform him into Two-Face. The character has been brought to life a few times on screen: Dennis Paladino filled the brief role in Batman Forever, and The Dark Knight saw Eric Roberts playing Maroni as a key figure in Dent's downfall. On the small screen, meanwhile, David Zayas appeared as Maroni across eight episodes of Gotham.We don't yet know if Sal Maroni himself has a part to play in the story of The Batman, but his frequent rival, Carmine Falcone, will be played in the film by John Turturro.At the end of the trailer, audiences get a flash of an obscure sort-of number-slash-code: ?0?1. Take the question marks out of the sequence and replace them with the digits that they look like — 2 — and you'll get 2021. This refers to The Batman's current release date of October 1, 2021, but it's also a pretty clear-cut reference to the film's main villain, the Riddler.Though the Riddler is only briefly pictured during the trailer, we do know that he's played by Paul Dano, and it's apparent that he'll spend the duration of The Batman psychologically tormenting the Caped Crusader.Beyond the Maroni reference and the tease that the Riddler is going to be the Big Bad of The Batman, the trailer is thin on substantial Easter eggs and intra-canon references. That said, there were a few moments that caught our attention that may or may not be meaningful. First off, Batman declaring I am vengeance could be a callback to a well-loved line from Batman: The Animated Series:Perhaps the full quote in the film includes some of that same dialogue as well. There's also the shot of newspaper clippings from the Gotham Gazette and The Gotham Times with the word LIES painted over them. Those clippings are from stories about Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell Jr., who made fictional history by winning a third mayoral term. In the film, Jayme Lawson will portray a Gotham City mayoral candidate named Bella Reál. Is the surname Reál a not-so-sly hint that she's genuine and Mitchell Jr. was a phony? And moreover, who is Don Mitchell Jr.? The only man with that name who has any kind of association with the Batman universe that we could find is Donald O. Mitchell, a sound engineer who was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on 1995's Batman Forever. This is probably a stretch but there could be something to chew on here.Additionally, in the scene in which a group of face-paint-wearing men square up against Batman, there can be spotted a young man whose face is only half painted. He stands out amongst the crowd members, who have their whole faces covered in black and white paint with various designs. Could this boy's inclusion in The Batman be a reference to Two-Face?Finally, there's the matter of a mystery man who pops up on two separate occasions. In one scene, he's simply staring down the camera with a menacing look on his face, and in the other, he's behind the wheel of a car that's being pursued. The character is fairly nondescript, and he doesn't really look like anyone on the Batman cast list, and the closest guess we can make would be that he's Oswald Oz Cobblepot — aka Penguin – played by Colin Farrell. That's a big leap and probably isn't correct, but there's a chance that it might be him.Sadly, it'll be a fairly long wait for all the unknowns to be resolved. The Batman will swoop into cinemas on October 1, 2021.

In this performance, that spot is empty.So how the heck did they do it?Honestly, it's best that you watch the whole video to experience the extent of the technical feat — which, in the spirit of Eilish's Saturday Night Live performance, they're willing to share with you. And thankfully, we still have our ways of photographing the desk, even if the room has fallen silent.So settle in for a welcome jolt of Tiny Desk innovation, not to mention two of the excellent standalone singles Billie Eilish has released in the past year: my future and everything i wanted. And, seriously, be sure to watch until the very end.SET LISTmy futureeverything i wantedMUSICIANSBillie Eilish: vocals, keys; Finneas: keys, guitarCREDITSVideo by: Matty Vogel; Audio by: Finneas; Art Director: Henry Hickman; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Photographer: Michael Cullen; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann",True,132,0,0,47,46,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,0,97,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,51,0,100,0,0,0,51,0,50,0,47,48,51,0,50,0,49,0,47,0,0,49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,98,0,0,0,16.96969696969697,27.551587809367057,3,5,4,132,0,0,47,46,0,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,46,0,0,51,0,0,0,0,0,97,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,51,0,100,0,0,0,51,0,50,0,47,48,51,0,50,0,49,0,47,0,0,49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,48,0,0,98,0,0,0,16.96969696969697,27.551587809367057,3

With BTS cooped up in Seoul, the group held true to the series's spirit by convening a live band for its Tiny Desk debut, and even arranged to perform in a workspace with a music-friendly backdrop: the record store VINYL & PLASTIC by Hyundai Card in BTS's hometown.Opening with this summer's inescapable Dynamite — the group's first single to hit No. 1 in the U.S., as well as its first song to be fully recorded in English — BTS leaned hard into the new track's celebratory, Uptown Funk-adjacent vibes. From there, the group dipped into its back catalog, seizing on the opportunity to showcase its quieter side while (mostly) staying uncharacteristically seated. The breezily propulsive Save ME, from 2016, ultimately gave way to a full-on power ballad in 2017's reflective Spring Day.The latter track seemed especially true to BTS's hopeful nature: Introduced with a few optimistic words from rapper and singer RM (It's been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come), the song reflects on a need to wait out hard times, even as the weight of present-day pain feels oppressive.BTS had intended to spend 2020 delighting the BTS Army in arenas around the world, only to spend these last few months performing in isolation.

The RTX 3090 is being positioned as a Titan replacement, as evidenced in part by limited SLI accessibility indicated on the 3080 and 3070, and it's not meant to be thought of as an NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti replacement. That said, NVIDIA is trying hard to bury its 1080 Ti and pull buyers forward to the new generation. We'll have to test them to see whether that's worth it. In the interim, partner cards will still have traditional cooler designs, but NVIDIA's reference design got creative and intends to push air straight into the CPU cooler (or rear of the case with an AIO/CLC) on one half of the card, but out the PCIe slot on the other half. We'll be discussing in this content, given our extensive thermal testing experience, what that design means for CPU tower and liquid coolers.

Kate Brown to support the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) with personnel and resources. It was part of a unified law enforcement plan the governor laid out Sunday night with hopes of ending the violence in Portland while also protecting the free speech of demonstrators.Brown announced her plan the night after a 39-year-old man was shot and killed in downtown Portland near protests.

The shooting followed a car rally in support of President Donald Trump.STORY: https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/protests/clackamas-washington-counties-no-deputies-portland-protests/283-2ba95e15-53bc-4ac4-8c16-0d3c56985f31",True,36,0,14,29,14,29,14,15,22,22,30,0,14,29,15,0,16,0,0,15,29,39,0,45,30,0,15,0,15,31,71,86,100,72,51,46,39,46,15,23,15,15,16,24,0,23,23,15,15,0,15,15,16,38,15,15,0,16,30,0,15,15,0,0,15,16,0,21.181818181818183,20.374456000106495,4,5,1,36,0,14,29,14,29,14,15,22,22,30,0,14,29,15,0,16,0,0,15,29,39,0,45,30,0,15,0,15,31,71,86,100,72,51,46,39,46,15,23,15,15,16,24,0,23,23,15,15,0,15,15,16,38,15,15,0,16,30,0,15,15,0,0,15,16,0,21.181818181818183,20.374456000106495,4

Featuring original performances and commentary from diverse talent across genres and shot live at iconic indie stages, #SOSFest aims to preserve our nation’s independent live music venues. The festival is raising funds for NIVA’s Emergency Relief Fund, where any member organization can apply for support - please consider helping by clicking the blue Donate button.  About NIVA: Formed at the onset of the COVID-19 shutdown, National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), now represents more than 2,800 members in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. These independent venues and promoters were the first to close and will be the last to fully reopen.

Over 1 million subscribers is a crazy thing for a 16 year old and i'm so very very thankful as I couldn't do it without you all. I've thought about it for a long time though and I think its best to move on to newer things and finish making videos on the GioFilms channel. It's a big decision, but i'm happy with it and the achievements this channel has reached!
